# Shared Task Notes

## Last Completed

- **pgmold-61**: Added PostgreSQL version requirements and security documentation to README
  - Supported versions table (13-17 with EOL dates)
  - CVE-2025-1094 warning with minimum recommended versions
  - Compliance notes (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA)
  - Commit: `6cae63a`

## Remaining Ready Tasks

All remaining tasks are priority 3 (feature requests):

- **pgmold-60**: ORM schema loading (Drizzle, Prisma) - significant effort
- **pgmold-58**: Kubernetes operator - significant effort
- **pgmold-57**: Migration dry-run with timing estimates - unique differentiator
- **pgmold-56**: Terraform provider - already exists per README, may need update

## Notes

- pgmold-56 may be a duplicate - check if Terraform provider docs need updating instead
- pgmold-57 (timing estimates) would be a nice differentiator vs competitors
